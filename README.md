# Factors-influencing-to-the-SAT-results-of-public-schools-in-New-York 
This portfolio project showcases my proficiency in handling real-world datasets, conducting thorough and insightful analyses, and effectively communicating valuable findings.

**Project Overview**

This analysis aims to explore the relationships between SAT scores and various demographic factors in New York City public schools. The objectives of the project include:

1. Investigating the potential correlation between AP exam scores and SAT scores among high schools.
2. Analyzing the equity aspect of the SAT by examining correlations between demographic factors such as race, gender, safety level, percentage of English learners, class size, and SAT scores.

The project utilizes Python and pandas for data analysis, along with data visualization tools to present the findings effectively.
